In this project, I analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. 

The goal is to search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best. 

I also explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

My search will involve joining datasets and comparing results with set theory. I also show more skills in filtering, grouping, and ordering data.

I'll answer these questions: 
  1. The ten best-selling video games
  2. Missing review scores
  3. Years that video game critics loved
  4. Was 1982 really that great?
  5. Years that dropped off the critics' favorites list
  6. Years video game players loved
  7. Years that both players and critics loved
  8. Sales in the best video game years
